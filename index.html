        <h3>After realizing that my previous job was going nowhere I knew I needed to go back to school. I know a lot of people who have degrees and can't find a job to save their life. They are in debt up to their eyeballs and I promised myself to never be one of those people. I first knew I wanted to study at Geek Wise when I saw a young man about my age at my job who appeared to be very well off financially. I asked him what he did and he said "programmer, if you want to get into that stuff check out BitWise" and the rest is history. </h3>
